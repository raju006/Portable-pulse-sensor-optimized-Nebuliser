# Portable-pulse-sensor-optimized-Nebuliser
portable nebuliser uses pulse sensor to detect the pulse rate, these signals are sent to nodemcu through which signals are sent to motor driver, then DC air pump is controlled. This optimisation of nebulisation rate is controlled,12v DC air pump has the capability of delivering 13L/min with rated current 800mA, which is powered using power banks with output of 5V, which insufficient to operate, there a DC- DC booster is used to step the voltage, according to the optimum rate. The pulse sensor send the analog input to nodemcu controller, which is programmed to send signals to the motor driver to run the 12V DC air pump. This project uses nodemcu which a wifi module and programming, equipment improvement domain based on the ESP8266, a minimal expense System-on-a-Chip. Through Blynk the signals sent to the DC air pump can also be controlled. So, That it provides a remote control access using the application.
